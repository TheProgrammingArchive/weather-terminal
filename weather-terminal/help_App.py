        Startup:
            When you first start up the app, it will ask you for your country and location. This is stored permanently and can be changed in the future.
            This system helps to reduce time when logging in to check the current weather
	
	    NOTE:You can view all the commands by entering --o or -options in the terminal. Use -help only when needing assistance with the app.

        Command line modifications:
            When in the MAIN command line you will see a > which denotes an input suggestion. Here you can enter any command from the list below!
            When in sections like weather ten day or weather today, you will see a >> which means you are in the terminal for that particular weather section.

        Settings:
            This app currently has a toggle feature which is enabled by default and can be changed later.
            Toggle helps to change the way the day/hour navigation system works under the weather ten day and weather today sections.
            If you have settings toggle enabled you can navigate using the letter P(Previous hr/day), N(Next hr/day), E(Extended info), Q(exit to main cli).
            If you have settings disabled then you can navigate using Enter(next day) or Q(exit to main cli).

        Location change:
            There are primarily 2 location change commands in this app. loc -p and loc -t
            Loc -p changes your permanent location, this changes every section in the app from the startup menu weather and the weather sections
            Loc -t changes your location temporarily, this is useful when you want to view another location temporarily
            To know if you're in a temporary location or not just scroll up and you'll see your location near the title
            If there is a text which says 'Temporary Location', it means you're currently not in the permanent selected location, an alternate way to check is by typing the command --loc, 
            this will tell you if you have permanent location selected or not
            
            To change back to permanent selected location type the command loc -pr and you'll be taken back.

        Title screen weather:
            When you load up the app, you will see a dropdown box which displays the hourly weather. This box is dynamic and the amount of information changes according to the size of your terminal.
            It is recommended to have your terminal on full screen or at least extended beyond the default size.

        Other information:
            Under the weather hourly section, if toggle is enabled and if it's the last hour of the day. The section will display only the particular weather for the next hour and exit the section
            Since weather.com uses a separate tag for the current weather, you can view it only by typing the command weather now.
            
            
        Exiting the app:
            Please try to use only the EXIT command to exit the app, you can use CTRL-Z ent or CTRL-C to exit but these exit methods create issues when in the loc -p section.
            If CTRL-C or CTRL-Z in pressed in the loc -p section, it leads to a corrupt file issue sometimes. The next time you open the app an error will be displayed on the screen.

        Errors:
            1. Port connection: 
                If you try to use the app without access to the internet or have a very slow connection. Sometimes you'll get a port connection error
                Make sure you're connected to the internet or just wait for sometime for the issue to get resolved
                
            2. File error:
                As mentioned in the above section (exiting the app), CTRL-Z ent or CTRL-C can produce errors when used in the loc -p section.
                When this occurs the app will close automatically and the next time you open it, the app will be reset meaning that you'd have to enter your permanent location again.
                Other than that there's no major issue using CTRL-Z ent or CTRL-C
                
            3. Requests error:
                This error can only occur if you modify the contents of any of the location files.
                If this occurs, make sure to delete the gotloc.txt file when launching the application again.
